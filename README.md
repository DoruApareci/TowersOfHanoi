## A simple implementation of the Towers of Hanoi in C#
This is a simple implementation of the Towers of Hanoi in C#. It is a WinForms application that takes a number of disks and solves the puzzle using a recursive algorithm for 3 towers. Also it allows the step-by-step visualization of all the movements performed with the possibility of pausing their progress. This also allows setting the speed between steps when viewing them. The visual part allows viewing up to 15 discs because of the color limitations for them, but the complete solution steps can be viewed on the graphic interface of the app. After forming the solution, the graphic interface also displays the number of steps required to solve the puzzle
